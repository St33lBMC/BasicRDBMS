# BasicRDBMS
A very, very basic and CRUDdy RDBMS I made a while back in like half an hour. I think it supports all CRUD operations? Usage: `python database.py`. <br/><br/> Commands: 
```
  "+": creates a new table
  "L": loads a pre-existing table
  "++": adds a row to currently selected table
  "-": deletes a row by index from currently selected table
  "/": modifies a row by index from currently selected table
  "p": prints table
  "x": closes the database program
```
Please never use this for any actual purpose.
